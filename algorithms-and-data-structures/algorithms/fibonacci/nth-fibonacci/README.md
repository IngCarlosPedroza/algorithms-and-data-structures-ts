# Fibonacci Number

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with the Fibonacci numbers at position 0 and 1, the first 11 terms will be:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

## Write the Fibonacci Number Algorithm

Write a function that computes the Fibonacci number at a given position (zero-based
index). Negative indexes must return zero.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function fibo (index: number): number
```
