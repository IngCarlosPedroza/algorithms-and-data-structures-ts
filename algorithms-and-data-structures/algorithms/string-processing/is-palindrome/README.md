# Is Palindrome

Write a function, `isPalindrome`, that takes a string as input, and returns `true` if
the string is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

The function signature is:

```typescript
function isPalindrome (str: string): boolean
```

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads
the same backward as forward.

Punctuation marks, white space, and case differences are ignored. All these are
palindromes:

- Racecar!
- racecar
- !? R . a :  ceca;r
